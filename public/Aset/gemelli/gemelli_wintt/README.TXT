GemelliA Cuttlefish Fontby Jason Pagura ©1997, 2001Gemelli is broadly based on my own handwriting, except that I rarely use lowercase letters or foreign characters. This rerelease now includes the Euro mark.It's great for adding that personal touch to modem-generated faxes, or anywhere that other non-cursive script fonts either look too formal or too sloppy. There is just enough irregularity to give a natural feel without looking like a six year old getting high with a Sharpie marker wrote it. (If that's what you want, other people have already made those sorts of fonts. Why reinvent the wheel?).Gemelli is freeware, which means you don't have to pay for it, use it wherever you want, and make copies of it for your friends. You may not, however, claim the font as your own design, or redistribute it for any charge. I designed Gemelli, and no one can say otherwise!In using my fonts, you agree to hold me harmless should any damage occour to your computer or other assetts. There shouldn’t be anything here to cause a problem, but weirder things have happened.While you don't have to pay for Gemelli, you are welcome to send whatever you feel is appropriate in appreciation of my work. Picture postcards of your home town, beef jerkey, demo tapes, and nude pictures of yourself or significant other are all acceptable forms of appreciation, but I'll take cash too, or whatever you can imagine.In case you should happen to need any illustration, graphic design, or custom font design, please think of employing my services.This font and other designs of mine can be found on my website:http://cuttlefish.8m.com/Send your comments and gifts towassergott@yahoo.comorJason Pagura10581 Stokes Ave.Cupertino, CA 95014-1239USA
